== Code Examples ==

 * [LoginExample Login Example] with Flex 3 and Flex 4 (Halo, Gumbo, Hero)
 * [ReligionChooser Religion Chooser] with Flex 4 (Gumbo)

== Why have I created these code examples? ==

 * I desirably love coding Flex :)
 * When applying for new jobs as Flex developer I usually show my clients these code examples so that they can evaluate if my Flex skills are of need to them. 
 * Because I haven't found any comparable Microarchitecture examples like this, I decided to create them myself.
 * I am trying to get feedback from the Flex community to improve the way I am suggesting coding Flex.
 * Because Flex is still a very young technology I am trying to give Flex beginners the opportunity to compare existing frameworks and architectures so that they can speed up their development time, and thereby, using less bad coding practices. 
 * For the moment, I see certain things that should to be improven in Flex development ... for more information please read the article [WhatsWrongWithFlex "What's wrong with Flex?"].
