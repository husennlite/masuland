= Thermo MK2 for Apache Flex =

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

== Introduction ==

This proposed Design Tool (codenamed Thermo MK2) should be seen as a hybrid of [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashcatalyst/articles/introducing-flashcatalyst-cs55.html Flash Catalyst CS5.5], the "Design View" of [http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html Flash Builder 4.6] and the [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse] IDE.

Things you can do with Thermo MK2 so far:
 * Switching Perspectives (see top-right) ... more information about Perspectives see [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse].
 * Switching between Source- and Design-Mode (see text editor in the middle) ... more information about the "Design View" see [http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html Flash Builder 4.6].

Things that Thermo MK2 should do:
 * Thermo MK2 should detect !SkinParts and !SkinStates of !SkinnableComponents.
 * Thermo MK2 should be able to draw graphics in a [http://sourceforge.net/adobe/flexsdk/wiki/FXG%202.0%20Specification/ FXG 2.0] compliant way.
 * Thermo MK2 should be able to import FXG files, Photoshop and Illustrator files.
 * Thermo MK2 should be able to communicate via a certain API with Flash Builder 4.7 or other IDEs.
 * Thermo MK2 should be able to visually manage and edit CSS files.
 * Thermo MK2 should be able to visually link !SkinnableComponents with their Skins within CSS files.
 * Thermo MK2 should be clever about screen sizes (compare with [http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/  Adobe Edge Reflow]).

The Data-Centric features are not necessarily needed because other IDEs would be more appropriate for that.

== Client with Flex 4.5 (Spark & MX) ===

The Thermo MK2 coding convention follows an [http://code.google.com/p/masuland/wiki/ApplicationDevelopmentProcedure Application Development Procedure] and a set of Architectual Patterns - hereby called [Nanoarchitecture Nanoarchitectures]. The used Nanoarchitectures can be summarized as follows: MVCpshCtlDS_PInj, see diagram below. Thermo MK2 uses the latest version of the [http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/ Parsley 3.0] Microarchitecture.
