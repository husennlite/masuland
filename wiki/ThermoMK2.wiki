= Proposal: Thermo MK2 for Apache Flex =

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

== Introduction ==

This proposed Design Tool (codenamed Thermo MK2) should be seen as a hybrid of [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashcatalyst/articles/introducing-flashcatalyst-cs55.html Flash Catalyst CS5.5], the "Design View" of [http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html Flash Builder 4.6] and the [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse] IDE.

Things you can do with this app so far:
 * Switching Perspectives (top-right) ... more information about Perspectives see [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse].
 * Switching between Source- and Design-Mode (text editor in the middle) ... more information about the "Design View" see [http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html Flash Builder 4.6]

== Client == 

=== Flex 4.5 (Spark) with MVCpshCtlDS_PInj ===

Features: Flex 4.5 (Spark) with [NanoarchitectureM "Model" (M)], [NanoarchitectureVCb "View - Component" (VCb)], [NanoarchitectureCpsh "C-Push" (Cpsh)], [NanoarchitectureCtl "Controller" (Ctl)], "Delegate" (D), "Service" (S) & [NanoarchitecturePInj "Property Injection" (PInj)] Nanoarchitectures

 * Flex 4.5 (Spark) Thermo MK2 for Web with Parsley 3.0 (MVCpshCtl, PInj), ([https://dl.dropbox.com/u/352808/code/ProposalThermoMK2/index.html web app]) ([https://dl.dropbox.com/u/352808/code/ProposalThermoMK2/srcview/index.html view source])


The source code follows certain Architectual Patterns summarized as MVCpshCtlDS_PInj, see diagram below.
