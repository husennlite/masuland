#summary This page shows different versions of the "Religion Chooser" application

= Religion Chooser =

The Religion Chooser application aims to be a fun application based on a decision tree structure created by [http://www.holytaco.com/flowchart-determine-what-religion-you-should-follow holytaco.com]. For more information about the application please read the [ReligionChooserFeatureSpec Religion Chooser Feature Specification] document. The following code examples provide solutions for several dimensions in Flex development:

 * *Flex SDKs* (Flex 4.1 "Gumbo" and Flex 4.5 "Hero" TODO)
 * *IoC Microarchitectures* ([http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/ Parsley 2.4.1], [http://www.springactionscript.org/ Spring AS 1.1], [http://www.swizframework.org/ Swiz 1.3.1])
 * *Nanoarchitectures* ([NanoarchitectureMVCb MVCp], [NanoarchitectureCpsh Cpsh], Ctl, [NanoarchitecturePInj PInj])

The code follows additional Flex coding conventions ([Flex4CodingConventions Flex 4]).
