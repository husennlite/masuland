<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

== Preface ==

The Religion Chooser app aims to be a quick and easy "Show Me The Code" guide for Flex beginners and intermediate Flex coders which try to build their first large-scale Flex app. While you can see the following code examples as a way I would recommend building these apps, I am not in the position to say that: "This is the way you have to do it".

== Introduction ==

The Religion Chooser app should be seen as a fun application based on a decision tree structure created by [http://www.holytaco.com/flowchart-determine-what-religion-you-should-follow holytaco.com]. For more information about the application please read the [ReligionChooserFeatureSpec Feature Specification] document. The following code examples provide solutions for several dimensions in Flex development:

 # *Flex SDKs* (Flex 4.1 "Gumbo" and Flex 4.5 "Hero" TODO)
 # *IoC Microarchitectures* ([http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/ Parsley 2.4.1], [http://www.springactionscript.org/ Spring AS 1.1], [http://www.swizframework.org/ Swiz 1.4])
 # *Nanoarchitectures* ([NanoarchitectureM M], [NanoarchitectureVCb VCp], [NanoarchitectureCpsh Cpsh], [NanoarchitecturePInj PInj], [NanoarchitectureCtl Ctl])
 # *Flex coding conventions* ([Flex4CodingConventions Flex 4]) 
 # *Project planning* (see [ReligionChooserFeatureSpec Religion Chooser Feature Specification])

== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ==

==== Why have you created the Religion Chooser? ==== 
Please read my [LetterOfMotivation Letter of Motivation].

==== I am new to this website. Where should I start? ==== 
Please check out this [ApplicationDevelopmentProcedure page].

==== What's a Nanoarchitecture? ==== 
Please read this page about [Nanoarchitecture Nanoarchitectures].

==== Which Microarchitecture has the best performance? ==== 
Don't know. Maybe somebody could create performance tests for it ;)

==== Which Microarchitecture do you prefer? ==== 
I am not making that decision for you. It is up to you to decide which one suites best to your needs.

==== I have found issues in your code examples. Where can I post them? ====
You can post problems and feature enhancements into my [http://code.google.com/p/masuland/issues/list issue tracker], or, you can contact me [http://www.masuland.com?content=contact directly].

==== Can I participate in your project? ====
Sure! There are still things left for me to do (see [http://code.google.com/p/masuland/issues/list issue tracker]). Any help would be appreciated!

==== Would you be willing to donate your code and docs to a higher instance? ====
Of cause! For the moment, I just haven't found the people sharing the same interest making the lifes of Flex beginners ... etc. easier building large-scale Flex apps. If I would see an authority growing up somewhere I would be happy to jump over. 

==== Who is this guy occupying land in the web? ====
Details about me can be found [http://masuland.wordpress.com/about/ here].
