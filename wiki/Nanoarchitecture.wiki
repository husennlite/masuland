#summary This page defines the meaning of the word "Nanoarchitecture"

= Nanoarchitecture =

Nanoarchitectures are small, architectural design solutions based on
Microarchitectures like [http://cairngormdocs.org/ Cairngorm 2.2.1], [http://puremvc.org/ PureMVC], [http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/ Parsley], [http://www.springactionscript.org/ Spring Actionscript], [http://www.swizframework.org/ Swiz], [http://mate.asfusion.com/ Mate], [http://www.robotlegs.org/ Robotlegs], [http://flicc.sourceforge.net/ Flicc] ... and others. There are three types of Nanoarchitectures: Interactional, structual and conceptual Nanoarchitectures.

*Interactional Nanoarchitectures*

 * "Model - View - Controller" (MVC or MVCtl)
 * [NanoarchitectureMVCb "Model - View - Code Behind" (MVCb)]
 * "Model - View - Code Behind - Controller" (MVCbCtl)
 * "Model - View - Code Behind - Command" (MVCbCmd)
 * "Model - View - Code Behind - Controller/Command" (MVCbCtlCmd)
 * "Model - View - Code Behind - Task" (MVCbTsk)
 * "Model - View - Code Behind - Story/Task" (MVCbStoTsk)

*Structural Nanoarchitectures*

 * "Controller" (Ctl)
 * "Command" (Cmd)
 * "Controller/Command" (!CtlCmd)
 * "Task" (Tsk)
 * "Story/Task" (!StoTsk)

*Conceptual Nanoarchitectures*

 * [NanoarchitectureNoEvt "No Event" (NoEvt)]
 * "Layer to Package" (L2P)
