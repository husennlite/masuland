== "Apache Flex and the imperfect Web" (2012-07-05, Berlin) ==

This presentation has been presented at the [http://www.flash-kiez.de Flex User Group in Berlin] on July 5th, 2012. I basically tried to cover the current state of Apache Flex, its possible future role in 2050 and compared Apache Flex with other Web technologies. I also tried to summarise my current work at Apache Flex. Hopefully, you'll find this presentation inspiring, too ;)
