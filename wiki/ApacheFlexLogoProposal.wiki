#summary This page proposes a possible Apache Flex Logo.

= Apache Flex Logo Proposal =

This would be my version of the Apache Flex logo:

<wiki:toc />

== Idea ==

This logo implies to me *"Safety"* for Flex ... because the feather (Apache) is covering (or protecting) Flex. *"Stability over Philosophy"* is the credo the new logo, and, Flex doesn't need to be reinvented because *"Flex is still Flex, and, now even better managed by Apache"*.

== Logo ==

[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/352808/code/ApacheFlexLogo/index.html Here is a Flex app version] to dynamically change the colors of the logo proposal. The source code for the Flex version can be found [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/352808/code/ApacheFlexLogo/srcview/index.html here].
