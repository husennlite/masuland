#summary This page proposes a possible Apache Flex Logo.

= Apache Flex Logo Proposal =

<wiki:toc />

== Idea ==

This logo implies to me *"Safety"* for Flex ... because the feather (Apache) is covering (or protecting) Flex. *"Stability over Philosophy"* should be the credo the new logo, and, Flex doesn't need to be reinvented because *"Flex is still Flex, and, now even better managed by Apache"*.

== Logo ==

This would be my version of the Apache Flex logo:

_The Photoshop version is available [http://masuland.googlecode.com/files/Apache_Flex-Logo.psd.zip  here]._

= Feedback =
