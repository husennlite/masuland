= Flex Application Architecture MVCb =

This document describes the application flow of the "Model - View - Code Behind" (MVCb) approach. In this architecture the presentation pattern "Code Behind" will be use as a synonym to the "Presentation Model" because they have lots of things in common. For comparison of these presentation pattern please read the articles of Paul Williams about [http://blogs.adobe.com/paulw/archives/2007/11/presentation_pa_5.html Code Behind] and the [http://blogs.adobe.com/paulw/archives/2007/10/presentation_pa_3.html Presentation Model].
