Why have I created these code examples?
  # When applying for new jobs as Flex developer I usually show my clients these code examples so that they can evaluate if my Flex skills are of need to them. 
  # I am trying to get feedback from the development community to improve the way I am suggesting coding Flex.
  # Because Flex is still a very young programming language I am trying to give Flex beginners the opportunity to compare existing frameworks and architectures so that they can speed up their development time, and thereby, using less bad coding practices. 
  # Usually I tend to say that "Flex development is expensive", and, in the following I will explain why this seems to be the case

== "Flex development is expensive" ==

Flex development is expensive because:

==== 1. Flex is very young ====

Flex is a very new technology. Flex 1 just came out in 2004 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flex see Wikipedia].

==== 2. Evolution of the Flashplayer and the Flex framework ====

Adobe plans to update their Flashplayer and Flex framework on faster release cycles (for times a year). While this also has pros, for developers this means your application constantly has to be updated and this could be an issue for big long-term projects.

==== 3. Evolution of Microarchitectures ====

Since the release of the Cairngorm 3 specification Adobe [http://sourceforge.net/adobe/cairngorm/home/Home/ suggests] the use of third party open source Inversion-of-Control (IoC) Microarchitectures like ([http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/ Parsley], [http://www.springactionscript.org/ Spring Actionscript], [http://www.swizframework.org/ Swiz], [http://www.robotlegs.org/ Robotlegs], [http://mate.asfusion.com/ Mate]). While this can be seen as a great opportunity to the open source community which create these Microarchitectures it also could have drawbacks

  * young developer community (compared to other communities like Java ... etc)
  * missing coding conventions
  * a lack of code generation tools and wizards to speedup development productivity
  * developer have different coding backgrounds (PHP, Java, ASP, HTML, Javascript ... etc)
  * only very few universities worldwide teach flex development
