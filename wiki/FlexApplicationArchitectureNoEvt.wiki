= Flex Application Nanoarchitecture - "No Event" (!NoEvt) =

This document describes the application flow of an Adobe Flex 3 and Flex 4 application written in the "No Event" (!NoEvt) nanoarchitecture. It is based on the [FlexApplicationArchitectureMVCb "Model - View - Code Behind" (MVCb)] nanoarchitecture but avoids dispatching events inside the application, see arrow (2) and (3) in the following diagram:

== Application Flows ==

Just like [FlexApplicationArchitectureMVCb MVCb] this nanoarchitecture contains 3 types of application flows:

1. Presentation Flow:
  * (1) User Interface calls function in the Code Behind (Flex 3) / Component (Flex 4) class
  * (9) Databinding updates User Interface

2. Action Flow:
  * (1) User Interface calls function in the Code Behind (Flex 3) / Component (Flex 4) class
  * (2) Code Behind (Flex 3) / Component (Flex 4) class calls Controller
  * (7) Processed data will be written back to the Model
  * (8) Databinding updates Code Behind (Flex 3) / Component (Flex 4) class
  * (9) Databinding updates User Interface

3. Business Flow:
  * (1) User Interface calls function in the Code Behind (Flex 3) / Component (Flex 4) class
  * (2) Code Behind (Flex 3) / Component (Flex 4) class calls Controller
  * (3) Controller calls the Delegate
  * (4) Delegate calls its implemented Service
  * (5) Service returns data
  * (6) Delegate returns data to registered Action (Event handler)
  * (7) Processed data will be written back to the Model
  * (8) Databinding updates Code Behind (Flex 3) / Component (Flex 4) class
  * (9) Databinding updates User Interface
